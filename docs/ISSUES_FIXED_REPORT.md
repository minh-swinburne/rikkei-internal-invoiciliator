# Issues Fixed - Summary Report

## ‚úÖ Issue Resolution Summary

### 1. Application Icon Implementation
**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
- **Problem**: App needed icon set to `src/assets/icon.png`
- **Solution**: 
  - Added icon loading to both `QApplication` and main window
  - Implemented defensive icon loading with error handling
  - Icon path: `src/assets/icon.png` (1024x1024 PNG, 1.2MB)
- **Result**: Application and dialog windows now display the custom icon

### 2. Organization Change to KDDI
**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
- **Problem**: App was branded as "Rikkei Corporation"
- **Solution**: Updated organization details in multiple locations:
  - `QApplication.setOrganizationName("KDDI")`
  - `QApplication.setOrganizationDomain("kddi.com")`
  - About dialog updated to "¬© 2025 KDDI Corporation"
- **Result**: Application now properly branded as KDDI

### 3. QPainter Errors Resolution
**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
- **Problem**: Multiple QPainter errors during application startup:
  ```
  QPainter::begin: Paint device returned engine == 0, type: 3
  QPainter::setCompositionMode: Painter not active
  QPainter::fillRect: Painter not active
  [multiple similar errors]
  ```
- **Root Cause**: Icon loading attempted before QApplication was fully initialized
